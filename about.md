I am an Assistant Professor of History and Digital Humanities at the University of Iowa. My research focuses on modern rural China, agricultural developments like land reform and collectivization, and social changes like communist revolution.

I was born and raised in a small town in southeast Michigan, received my B.A. (Asian Studies and Physics) and M.A. (Chinese Studies) from the University of Michigan, and then my Ph.D. (Humanities/Chinese History) from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Before starting at the University of Iowa I spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Research Center for Chinese Social History at Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.

While at the U of M I lived in a vegetarian student cooperative, where I was in charge of food and supply purchasing, and networked with farmers at the local market. After finishing my M.A. I joined [World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF)][1] and spent a year working on farms and learning Japanese in rural Japan. I have also lived and worked on farms in Northeast China, Hong Kong and the U.S.
