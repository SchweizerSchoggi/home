My website is already looking more sophisticated, thanks to the [jekyll-uno theme][1], made by Josh Gerdes (2016). It took me a while to figure out how to add page buttons to the title screen - by editing the header file in _includes - but now I feel like I learned something.

I'm not sure how to give proper credit to him, so that's why I am writing this post.
