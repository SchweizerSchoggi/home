Towards the end of high school I became interested in Chinese philosophy and religion  through popular literature. I decided to start learning Mandarin Chinese halfway through my undergraduate career, which only further sparked my interest. After finishing my B.A. I spent most of the next decade living in East Asia - 1 year in Japan, 4 years in Hong Kong, and 3 years in mainland China. Through studying the text of the Zhuangzi for my M.A., I discovered how important the history of the book's compilation was for understanding its meaning, and through this experience realized how the past plays such a pervasive role in all of Chinese society, from family ancestors to political institutions. During my time in East Asia I also gained a deep respect for Chinese social organization. I don't think any other society in the world has maintained similar levels of culture, diversity, and hierarchy at such a large scale or for such a long time.
